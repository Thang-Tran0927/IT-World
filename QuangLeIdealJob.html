    <h1>A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appeals to you.</h1>
    <br>
    <p><center></p>
    <p> 
        My ideal job would be a risk manager at a multinational company. In this example I choose Manulife, a multinational insurance company in Canada.<br> 
        The appeal of the job for me is the work environment, working in a multinational company, and work in the field I wanted to be in, which is risk management. 

    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>A description of the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>  
        The job would require me to have a bachelor’s degree, preferably in Finance or Business Administration, at least 5 years working experience, preferably in Risk Management, Compliance, Audit, Finance, Operations, being proactive and hungry in terms of growing within the company, the ability to work in a team and foster collaboration with other departments, being highly analytical with attention to detail and accuracy, a sound business acumen and finally being good with Microsoft Office tools, especially Excel & PowerPoint. 
        <br>
        I’m currently on my way to finishing my bachelor’s degree in international business, I’m proactive in my desire to climb the company’s rankings, I’ve always been highly analytical with attention to detail and accuracy, I can work with a team and I am highly collaborative. 
        <br>
        The things I’m lacking are the 5 years work experience and a sound business acumen. 

        
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>A description of the skills, qualifications, and experience you currently have.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Skills:<br> 
        Beginner at Java<br>
        Intermediate at Python<br>
        Beginner at working with databases using SQL<br>
        Beginner with data structures and algorithms<br>
        
        
        Qualifications:<br>
        Graduated from the IB (International Baccalaureate)  program
        
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Future Plan For Myself</h1>
    <p>
        The plan for obtaining the work experiences and business acumen is to work. I plan to first do a full online RIMS-CRMP course for my qualification in risk management. I would then, with my degree and my RIMS-CRMP qualification, apply for internships in risk management in consulting firms in Vietnam (preferably those I have connections with like KPMG). 
        <br>
        I would also work as a risk manager assistant for my home company, so I can stack up my work experience and hone my business acumen.

        
    </p>

    <br>
    <h1>Comparison</h1>
    <p>
        
        When comparing our ideal jobs, the stand out commonality is that all our jobs required IT skills and knowledge, although the levels varied between jobs. My ideal job, risk management, only required minimal IT skills in being good at Microsoft Office tools. The others are more geared towards IT and thus require more sophisticated  and higher level IT skills, with Minh opting for software development, Thang aiming to be a backend developer and Hoang choosing to be a game developer. 
        <br>
        The differences are very clear, considering my ideal job is not in the IT sector, while the other three are.
