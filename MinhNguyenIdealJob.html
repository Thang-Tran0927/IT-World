    <h1>A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appeals to you.</h1>
    <br>
  
    <p> 
        Firstly, this job is situated in Hanoi and relatively close to where I live so I will not have issues traveling to work. Secondly, the job offers a very generous salary and bonus while not demanding as many requirements as other jobs I have found. This means I will be able to fulfill the requirements in a short time after graduating from RMIT. And as a bonus, we will be working for Japanese customers which will provide me some insight into how foreign companies request programs. 
        
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>A description of the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>  
        This position demands that I have at least 6-month experience in web programming with Java and C#  and be proficient in web services such as SOAP, RESFUL, MVC API. In addition, I need to have enough knowledge to create a frontend interface using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax. As well as have knowledge in databases and proficient in SQL commands and have good usage of source management tools using Git and SVN.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>A description of the skills, qualifications, and experience you currently have.</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        At this moment, I am still very new to IT and still unfamiliar with all those tools and programming languages but I hope I can learn about them further in my studies at RMIT. For further requirements, there are a myriad of YouTube videos and online tutorials on programming languages or SQL commands. 

    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Future Plan For Myself</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        I would prefer RMIT teaching all of the listed programs and programming languages. But if they are not available in RMIT curriculums, I am always willing to learn them through other methods such as YouTube tutorials, online tutor classes. For example, I can learn C# through a free YouTube course by freeCodeCamp. Or a MySQL YouTube course by Programming by Mosh.

    <h1>Comparison</h1>
    <br>
    <p style="padding-bottom:150px;">
        The majority of the ideal jobs of our team members require knowledge in IT and programming. With the exception of Le Nhat Quang, whose ideal job is to be a risk manager for Manulife. This is understandable as his major is in International Business, not IT. While the rest of us all aspire to have jobs in the IT field, each of our jobs differ from one another. For example, my ideal job would be a software developer at City Ascom. While Hoang would like to become a game developer. Or Thang, who would like to become a back-end engineer for Shopee. When it comes to the plans to reach these ideal jobs, everybody seems to wish to use their time working in teams as RMIT to hone their abilities of operating in a group to aid them in their work in the future. Various members such as Hoang, Quang or myself plan on attending online courses or tutorials as a mode of learning new skills, whereas Thang seems to have a clear-cut plan for which courses he would take during his time at RMIT. Most of us are still rather unsure about the specifics about how we would attain the required knowledge to reach our ideal jobs, most methods are still limited to RMIT courses or online courses. But Quang, with this year being his last year at RMIT and being the eldest, he seems to have a much clearer and realistic plan compared to ours. No matter the differences we have among each other, I think we know that we all have passion for what we wish to do and are trying our hardest to reach them.
