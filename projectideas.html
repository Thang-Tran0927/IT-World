            <p style="padding-right:60px; padding-left:80px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Our project will be about developing a phone, browser and possibly even windows app that focuses on allowing people to create schedules, events, share them with others and even create groups that combine their schedules to allow them to select a time and date for an event or meeting. There will also be options for picking time and day such as a ‘minimum’ feature that allows you to set the minimum number of people available to qualify as a suitable day and time for a meeting. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-right:60px; padding-left:80px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Our main motivation behind this project is the frustration and inconvenience our team members face when scheduling with our friends and peers. Finding the most suitable day while keeping in mind everyone's schedule is rather tedious and far more complicated than it should be. The same problem can occur when you are organizing events such as class reunions, family trips or in business, meetings with your peers or scheduling board meetings between shareholders and investors. Nowadays everybody has daily schedules that they need to follow and conflicting schedules are inevitable. That is why I would like to alleviate some of the dull processes. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-right:60px; padding-left:80px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> First, we will start our project as a smartphone app. We will expand it to a website and a Windows application once we have more knowledge and direction. Upon opening, you will have to create an account and sign in. One of the main features it will have is, of course, a calendar that can be used to create schedules. Each item that you make on the schedule will have an option to be “recurring” and you can choose between “daily”, “weekly”, “monthly” and “yearly” which according to your settings will automatically set the same event correspondingly to what recurring option you pick. This feature can be used even when your phone is not connected to wifi. Moving on, the next feature is the ability to share your schedule with somebody, with the option to allow a view-only mode or allow them to edit your schedule. Another feature is “Create group” which allows you to add several members into the group where a schedule will appear with each member’s schedule overlapping. Here, you can find options such as “Minimum number of attendants” which allows the software to highlight days and time periods where that amount of people are free. This feature is mostly for when your group realizes it is not possible to organize an event that can include everyone so you would need to settle with a time that is missing the least amount of members. Each time block will also allow you to embed certain links such as meeting links, in case the meeting will take place online or links to online documents such as google docs or google sheets. An option to turn on a task-tracker will also be available in case you are working with your peers. Here, tasks progression will be tracked and displayed with a progress bar to give a visual representation of what your team has or has not completed. You can set deadlines and reminders for each task on the list. There will also be a comment system where you can pick a span of time and put a type of note there to add more details to those days and time. For example around February is when Vietnam’s Lunar New Year will begin and for about a week, the majority of stores, restaurants and various services will be unavailable. So if your group’s plan was to go to a restaurant, those days would not be viable. Or perhaps if your group would like to avoid meeting at rush hour, you can exclude rush hour periods on all days. Aside from this, there will also be a weather display system. In which the data will be taken from a weather forecast database online to display temperature, weather of each day and each time span. You can also set weather options such as “Exclude rain” or “Sunny only” or even “Exclude Sunny”. Depending on how many people are available, the different time periods on the schedule table will be highlighted with different gradients ranging from red to green, with red being no one and deep green being everyone is available. Here is a rough visual mockup of our software:
            </p>
            <center><img src="Images/weekly-schedule.png" height="600px" width="800"></center>
            <p style="padding-right:60px; padding-left:80px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Since our software will be a smartphone app, we need to know how we can publish our work on distribution channels such as the AppStore or GooglePlay Store. Development for our software will require extensive experience with coding. Specifically Python, which is what I will most likely use to write the codes for the software. MySQL will be essential for me to implement a weather API into our software to display and account for the weather and temperature of each day and time periods. Photoshop and Paint 3D will be heavily used to customize and design icons for our app. With the help of online tutorials and YouTube videos, I believe I will be able to gain the necessary knowledge to operate said softwares. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-right:60px; padding-left:80px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Programming skills will be very important as Python will play a major part in the development of the app. Aside from coding and programming, our app will also require visual representation and a simple UI to make the app as user-friendly as possible. So skills involving Photoshop and Paint 3D are needed. Since this app will need user accounts to work properly, I will need to create a database to store those accounts, doing so demands experience and skill in MySQL. Additionally, because weather will play a role in our app, learning how to implement a weather API will also be mandatory. Said skills can be gathered from our studies at RMIT as well as YouTube videos and online tutorials. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding-right:60px; padding-left:80px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:150px;";"> If the project is successful, I will have created a tool that is available to everyone to assist in organizing events. It will help businesses with scheduling meetings, allow anyone to create and share their schedules, and help people save time when getting together. And most importantly, it makes our lives more convenient. This lets us walk the first few steps on our path to achieving our dream career.
