                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> When it comes to the state of the art of robotics, human-like robots are undeniably one of the most popular in this sector of technology. Human-like robots, like humans, can accomplish practically everything an ordinary person can do, and the results suggest that the robots even outperform them. One of the most prominent examples would be the use of bartender robots, which could serve up to 300 drinks per hour while an average bartender could only produce about 140 glasses. The former doubled the latter, and as a consequence, we could see the benefits of utilizing robots over people. In contrast, even when synchronized with the most technological facilities, there is still something that robots lack, and that is the understanding of feelings, which can manifest itself in a variety of ways, such as showing empathy, emotions, even humour, and also the recognition that they are only robots. There was an example of a robot with great self-awareness drowning in water after understanding it was simply a tool for humans. So, what will happen in the future if robots can now comprehend emotions and have a high level of self-awareness? Should society see them as human since they possess all of the characteristics that distinguish mankind from others, or will they continue to be regarded as "normal robots"? This is still a controversial subject among scientists since theoretically, robots made of metal do not have a soul like humans, thus treating them as regular beings would be unthinkable. For illustration, if the lives of a robot with a good knowledge of feelings and self-awareness and a typical human being are on the line, who would you end up saving?(1) On the other hand, robots might help us explore locations where humans can not go, such as space exploration. I think that in the next few years, NASA will send more and more robots to investigate the cosmos. For instance, without the aid of the robot rover, we would never know what "life" is like, and the future seems promising in this area. If the correct technology is used, life on other planets might become a reality. In 2054, a metropolis called NÃ¼wa is planned to be established on Mars with the assistance of robots (2). Still, this goal is unlikely to be accomplished unless we have the necessary knowledge and technology to comprehend how building requires a combination of in-situ energy and intelligent construction technologies. Construction materials include Martian dirt, basalt, and Martian concrete. The materials used in construction are anticipated to resist the harsh Martian environment. (3)

                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Recently, the robot industries have had and will leave a huge impact on humanity. factories, workshops were used to be the place packed with a large amount of people now are being replaced by robots which on the first hand, enterprises are gaining more and more productivity (Tradeology quote that "Among all industries, a one percent increase in robot density correlated with an increase in productivity of 0.8 percentâ). It is also undeniable that by installing more robots, business organizations could save a considerable amount of money, wasted time caused by hiring human laborers (companies could save up to 21%). moreover, robots are the important factors to any further discoveries in the future ranging from hazardous environments: volcanoes which could heat up to 1200 degrees, bottom floor of the ocean where a normal person would definitely die from the cold, air shortage as well as an enormous amount of water pressure, to outer space which humanity canât explore without robots, and even with universal help by robots, scientists have only discovered 4% of the visible universe. Without the robotsâ help, humanity couldnât get this far. On the other hand, a negative impact will be witnessed on low-income people. Because there are no corporations willing to hire human laborers except the electricians who are in charge of observing and fixing the robots when it encounters a problem. In some cases, if the human laborers are hired, the wage would not match with the excessive work and low-quality workspace that they have to experience. As a result, people whose previous jobs were in factories or mainly related to physical activities, etc now would be âforcedâ to be unemployed initially causing an unbalanced growth to a country. This, in other words, would be troublesome for low-educate people which took up to 9,2% of the world population, while in contrast, this field of technology is creating thousands of opportunities for people with higher-education with a starting far outweighing the former one.

                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; padding-bottom:100px;";"> I feel that robots have changed our lives forever, even if just in the most insignificant aspects. In my experience, robots have made my life considerably simpler. For example, because I am usually busy with university work, I hardly have any time to polish my room, but the robot cleaner is the major component in maintaining a clean workplace environment, preserving my health. A small machine like that has already had a substantial influence on my life, so I am convinced that in the future, owing to rapid technological improvements in robotics, humanity's life in general, and mine in particular, will be much simpler. And because robots are designed to make our lives easier, we will start to rely on these types of technology more and more. One of the clearest examples for me would be the robot vacuum, which is obviously beneficial, but at the same time, the user is losing basic essential survival abilities, which contributes to poor physical and mental health and , as well as the development of a poor characteristic. For the time being, robots do not have a significant impact on my life. Of course, I still rely on things such as vending machines or ATMs, but not in the way that my life is entirely dependent on them. And I honestly can't imagine what my life would be like in the next several years when technology takes over the world. To be more precise, America, the technological paradise, has already used an electric car (Tesla) with a self-driving capability, and it is unimaginable how robots will enhance and modify our lives in the future, but they will undoubtedly have a major influence. As I previously indicated, whether it is myself or my family and friends, the influence of this technological area is evident, and everyone should be prepared for the worst/best possibilities, in which they will either lose their work due to robots or their life will be elevated to a whole different level.
