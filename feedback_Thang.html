                <p style="padding-left:50px; padding-right:50px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Over the past few weeks, I have had the honor to be working with my 3 teammates on developing a website from scratch as well as brainstorming ideas for our projects.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left:50px; padding-right:50px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> First off, I would rate myself as being consistent and helpful throughout the process of us working together. I was able to do the tasks I was assigned before the deadline set by our group. I try to help others in the field that I excel in which is in the website development process. Since I have some prior experience in using HTML, CSS, and Javascript I was able to give advice to my teammates during the process. This helps make up for my lack of input during the brainstorming stage of our project idea as I am usually shy and donâ€™t speak out my thoughts as often. In the future, I wish to build more confidence in myself in order to become more active during group discussions.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left:50px; padding-right:50px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">For Minh, I see him as our leader for the project. He helped make it clear who is responsible for which tasks and helped us create a plan to follow in order to complete the project smoothly. In addition, he is also the one that sets up all the meetings. These meetings help everyone be on the same page as to who is doing what and if anyone is having any issues.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left:50px; padding-right:50px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">When it comes to Hoang, I see him as a very consistent teammate. He might not excel in any particular field but he does what is assigned to him and is a quick learner. He is useful during group discussion as he is able to provide feedback on our teammates' ideas and help come up with ways to improve on it.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left:50px; padding-right:50px; word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">Lastly, Quang was very active when it came to group discussions and group ideas. Since he is the oldest of all of us, he is able to provide his insights and experience to us which was very helpful during our brainstorming for the project idea. In addition, having a different major than us helps us gain a different viewpoint which also helps us immensely when trying to come up with interview questions for the IT professional.
