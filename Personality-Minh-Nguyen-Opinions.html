    <h1 style="font-size:30px;padding:20px;padding-top:150px;">What do the tests result mean for Minh?</h1>
    <br>
    <p> 
        The Myers-Briggs test shows my personality type, my traits, the role I would be suited for the most in a team and my strategy. From what I can see, I am highly introverted and one of my biggest flaws. Although being introverted is fine, the test shows that I am extremely introverted so this may bring up complications when acquainting myself with my teammates as well as when it comes to sharing our ideas. However, now that I know this weakness, I will be able to focus on bettering this side of me. The test also tells me I am a slightly intuitive person. Therefore, I can pay more attention to details in my teamâ€™s works and identify mistakes and flaws or even ways to improve certain aspects. I am always pondering, questioning and seeking answers. This trait can help me be a quick-learner as I am always eager to satisfy my curiosity by learning and studying. From the test, I gathered that I am constantly prospecting. Such a trait is beneficial as it helps me plan ahead by considering future outcomes of my decisions which can also be implemented in teamwork since I am able to consider the best and optimal outcomes for my group. Although this may cause me to seem indecisive, it is essential when it comes to risk managing. And finally, the last trait and my favorite is I am a turbulent person. I am always striving for perfection and to constantly improve myself. With this, I can always help my team improve their work.


        The learning style test shows I am mostly a visual learner which means my information intake mostly comes from watching and observing. This is very helpful because now that I know what my learning style is, I know how to learn more effectively to do well in my studies.
        
        
        The Big Five personality test depicts my personality traits fairly accurately. I have a nice balance when it comes to openness. I am willing to learn and experience new things to a degree but I am also fine with what I have at the moment. I am a rather conscientious person. This means I have a sense of responsibility, I am organized and hard-working which are excellent qualities for a great teammate. I am not extraverted. I do not seek validation and praises from my peers and deem my judgement of my own character to be more important. However, this may seem like I am conservative but I am not. I am completely open to criticisms but I also self-criticize and I find that more important. I am a rather agreeable person. I struggle with making new friends because of how shy I am but once people get to know me and I become more comfortable around them, people will find I am great to be around. The test shows that my neuroticism is very prevalent. I tend to become upset or angry rather easily, especially towards my mistakes or my short-comings. But I see it as just another force that pushes me to always improve myself and become a better person.

    <h1 style="font-size:30px;padding:20px;">How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>  
        The results from each test helps me understand more about myself and see my weaknesses as well as where I excel. I think it is a great guide for which parts of myself I should be focusing on the most to improve how I am currently.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h1 style="font-size:30px;padding:20px;">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h1>
    <br>
    <p style="padding-bottom:200px;">
        I believe these results show that when in a team, I will most likely not be a team leader but rather someone who analyzes our teamâ€™s work and provides constructive criticisms throughout the working process. I will be paying very close attention to my teammatesâ€™ contributions and ideas, finding and picking ones that will benefit the entire group the most. When forming a team, I should seek out people with skills and traits that complement mine, especially a great leader figure but also averting having teammates whose traits overlap one another as that can lead to disagreements and drag the efficiency of the entire group down.
