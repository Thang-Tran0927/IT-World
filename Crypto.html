                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Cryptocurrency is a type of currency that is completely digital. These types of currency are not managed by the government and instead use a decentralized ledger to keep track of all the transactions that have been made [3]. Cryptocurrency can be used to exchange for goods or services just like any other commonly used currency. Some examples may include Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Etherium [2]. In order to keep all the recorded transactions secured, cryptocurrency takes advantage of various methods of cryptography to make sure all the data is secured and verified when a transaction occurs like blockchain, digital signature, and hash functions.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><i> What technological or other developments make this possible?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Digital Signature and hash functions are the main ways that cryptocurrencies use to secure transactions that are made. Every single transaction that is made in a cryptocurrency will require a digital signature from the person creating the transaction [1]. For example, if Bob pays Alice 5 Bitcoin, Bob will need to provide a digital signature to show that he has approved the transaction. How each digital signature is made is by using hash functions for example SHA-2561. This is done by putting in the content of the message as well as the user’s private key into the hash function. This will produce a random set of strings that is not interpretable. In addition, this process will not be reversible. The only way people can read the message is by putting the string and the public key into the function to see if it will generate the right message.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><i> What can be done now? What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Cryptocurrency values are constantly changing based on media coverage on people’s attention to the currency. When Bitcoin was first invented, its value was very low due to it being a new currency and not a lot of people were willing to switch from using paper money to a digital currency that they knew nothing about. Bitcoin value rises gradually over time.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><b> Blockchain</b>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><i> ​What is the state of the art of this new technology?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Blockchain is a type of ledger used by most cryptocurrencies to help keep the data from being tampered with [6]. Blockchain is a type of ledger designed specifically for data to be entered and cannot be easily altered [6]. Through the block system, once data is entered it will be hard for data to be changed without changing the rest of the data in the ledger. In addition, blockchain is a distributed system, therefore each computer or node in the system will have a copy of the ledger as well as be able to maintain it.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><i> What technological or other developments make this possible?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> In a blockchain, data is structured into chunks or “blocks”. Each block will contain information like the transaction information as well as the hash number for that block and the block before it [6]. This creates a relationship between all the blocks in the ledger. If someone tries to change data inside a block, it will change the hash number of that block and it will not match with the hash stored on the other block.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">Blockchain is based on a distributed system where every computer will have the ledger and be able to maintain it [6]. This makes the system more secure the more users are in the system. Since there are many copies of the ledger in the system, the most common ledger will be regarded as the correct ledger of the system. This makes it hard for a person to try to tamper with the ledger. If they only tamper with one ledger, it will not make any significant difference. They will have to change more than half of the ledger for the system to recognize which will require a lot of resources.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><i>What can be done now? What is likely to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</i>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">As of now, blockchain is only being used in cryptocurrency to store transactions. However other industries have noticed the benefits of blockchain is starting to take advantage of the technology. The health industry [7] is one of the few that is taking advantage of blockchain for the purpose of storing health data. Blockchain will not only improve the security of the data being stored but also the speed of data being accessed [7]. Examples of companies using blockchain include MedRec, DYNOSTICS,...

                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px; padding-top:40px; font-size:30px;";"><b>What is the likely impact?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><b>Cryptocurrency</b>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">As Cryptocurrency gets more and more popular, there will be more concerns regarding the environment [3]. Since a lot of computers are being used to verify the transactions that are being made, that requires a lot of electricity to run and therefore causes problems such as pollution and waste being produced since energy sources such as fossil fuels need to be used to generate the electricity.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">If cryptocurrency ever becomes the main form of exchange, people will find fewer uses for banks. Since cryptocurrencies are managed by the public. People can make transactions with each other directly without going through a medium ground like a centralized banking system. This has both its benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, people will not have to worry about things like interest rates or exchange rates [2]. Not only that, transactions will be able to happen much faster since we do not have to rely on the transaction being processed by a medium like a bank [2]. In addition, a new field with new jobs will be available for people to choose like bitcoin mining where people will try to verify transactions through the use of computing power. Additionally hardware that is designed specifically for crypto mining would become more accessible for the usual customer. At the present day, a Graphics Processing Unit by NVIDIA with the purpose of cryptocurrency mining will cost more than $5,000 [5]. As more people started to treat cryptocurrency as a real currency, these hardware are expected to become more affordable for the common consumer.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">On the other hand, all the banks that have been operating for years will have to be shut down.. In addition, people who have spent countless time and resources to build a career in banking will find themselves out of a job and have to adapt to the new changes of cryptocurrency being the norm.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><b>Blockchain</b>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">Because of the advantages that blockchain offers, blockchain will likely be the main way that large companies and corporations uses to store their data. Blockchain will likely replace traditional ways of storing data in databases. With this change, people will need to be educated to be able to operate on this new technology. New courses and experts will need to be trained.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">In addition blockchain could change the way that we identify ourselves in the digital world. As of now, we use passwords to prove our identity which have the risk of being hacked or stolen by others. With the use of blockchain, each user can be stored in the blockchain with a unique set of numbers that is not easily changed or hacked by others without knowing the private key [8].
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px; padding-top:40px; font-size:30px;";"><b>How will this affect you?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><b>Cryptocurrency</b>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";">As of the present day, These things will not have any major effect on my daily life. Since cryptocurrency has not been used by the majority of the people, it has not caused major changes. In the future, cryptocurrency will have a significant impact on how we use currency. No paper money will be needed and all transactions will happen digitally which is really convenient as we only need to carry a single card instead of an entire wallet.  In addition, cryptocurrency will be much more secure than with the currency used today. This will help relieve me from worrying if my account will get hacked since it will become progressively harder for people to tamper with the data the more people use cryptocurrency.
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"><b>Blockchain</b>
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; padding-bottom:100px;";">Blockchain will likely have minimal impact on my daily lives since blockchain has more uses when it comes to big corporations and companies because of the number of users and their emphasis on being efficient and having their data secured. However, it can still be used similarly to a version control system like git. When working on a project, each version of a codebase can be stored in the blockchain to keep track of all the changes that have been made to it.
