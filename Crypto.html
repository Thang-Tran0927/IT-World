                    <h2>​What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h2> 
                        <p class="headings">Cryptocurrency</p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Cryptocurrency is a type of currency that is completely digital. These types of currency are not managed 
                        by the government and instead use a decentralized ledger to keep track of all the transactions that have been made3. Cryptocurrency can be used to exchange for goods or 
                        services just like any other commonly used currency. Some examples may include Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Etherium2. In order to keep all the recorded transactions secured, 
                        cryptocurrency takes advantage of various methods of cryptography to make sure all the data is secured and verified when a transaction occurs like blockchain, digital signature, 
                        and hash functions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="headings">Blockchain</p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Blockchain is a type of ledger used by most cryptocurrencies to help keep the data from being tampered with 6. 
                        Blockchain is a type of ledger designed specifically for data to be entered and cannot be easily altered 6. Through the block system, once data is entered it will be hard for data 
                        to be changed without changing the rest of the data in the ledger. In addition, blockchain is a distributed system, therefore each computer or node in the system will have a copy 
                        of the ledger as well as be able to maintain it. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h2> 
                        <p class="headings">Cryptocurrency</p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Digital Signature and hash functions are the main ways that cryptocurrencies use to secure transactions that are 
                        made. Every single transaction that is made in a cryptocurrency will require a digital signature from the person creating the transaction1. For example, if Bob pays Alice 5 Bitcoin, 
                        Bob will need to provide a digital signature to show that he has approved the transaction. How each digital signature is made is by using hash functions for example SHA-2561. 
                        This is done by putting in the content of the message as well as the user’s private key into the hash function. This will produce a random set of strings that is not interpretable. 
                        In addition, this process will not be reversible. The only way people can read the message is by putting the string and the public key into the function to see if it will generate 
                        the right message. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="headings">Blockchain</p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> In a blockchain, data is structured into chunks or “blocks”. Each block will contain information like the 
                        transaction information as well as the hash number for that block and the block before it 6. This creates a relationship between all the blocks in the ledger. If someone tries to 
                        change data inside a block, it will change the hash number of that block and it will not match with the hash stored on the other block. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Blockchain is based on a distributed system where every computer will have the ledger and be able to maintain it6. 
                        This makes the system more secure the more users are in the system. Since there are many copies of the ledger in the system, the most common ledger will be regarded as the correct 
                        ledger of the system. This makes it hard for a person to try to tamper with the ledger. If they only tamper with one ledger, it will not make any significant difference. 
                        They will have to change more than half of the ledger for the system to recognize which will require a lot of resources. 

                    </p>

                    <p class="headings">Cryptocurrency</p>
                <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Cryptocurrency values are constantly changing based on media coverage on people’s attention to the currency. 
                    When Bitcoin was first invented, its value was very low due to it being a new currency and not a lot of people were willing to switch from using paper money to a digital 
                    currency that they knew nothing about. Bitcoin value rises gradually over time.

                <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> As of now, blockchain is only being used in cryptocurrency to store transactions. However other industries have 
                    noticed the benefits of blockchain is starting to take advantage of the technology. The health industry7 is one of the few that is taking advantage of blockchain for the purpose of 
                    storing health data. Blockchain will not only improve the security of the data being stored but also the speed of data being accessed7. Examples of companies using blockchain include 
                    MedRec, DYNOSTICS,...</p>
