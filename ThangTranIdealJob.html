    <h1>A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appeals to you.</h1>
    <br>

    <p> 
        I’ll be working with other software developers to create programs suitable for online shopping (Ex. designing systems/features to improve the user’s experience when shopping online)
Task: 
Designing system/features to optimize the checkout and order lifecycle across a high volume of transactions
 Design software that is optimized and scalable
Write code that is easy to understand and maintain using modern practices
Research and develop ways to improve features and development processes
Be able to work in groups and collaborate with other software engineers and other wide range of people
This job appeals to me because there are other benefits aside from the job such as insurance that will help me feel safe while working. In addition, being able to collaborate with a wide range of people will help me develop my network of people which is a very important thing to have as having connections with different people can help me widen my skills. Not only that, I will be able to enjoy my job since I’ll be developing software which is one of the things that I like to do in my free time.

    <h1>Comparison</h1>
    <br>
    <p style="padding-bottom:25px;">
        
        Similarities:<br>
        Most of our jobs have similar skills requirements. The ideal jobs of Hoang, Minh, and I all required us to have knowledge of a specific set of programming languages. In addition, we need to be able to have the skills that are required in our chosen field. For example, Minh needs to have experience in game development while my ideal job requires experience in network protocols. 
    </p>
    <p style="padding-bottom:150px;">
        Differences:<br>
        All of our ideal jobs are targeted at different fields. For example, My ideal job is mainly focusing on software development while Nhat Quang is more focused on the business, especially risk management, or Hoang who is more focused on game development. We all have different visions on what field we find most interesting. 
        In addition, our job experiences are different. For example, Quang’s jobs have a lot more requirements than Minh's. Quang's job required a year of experience working in that field on top of the skills required while Quang’s job only required the applicant to meet the skills requirements.
