    <h1>What do the tests result mean for Thang?</h1>
    <p> 
        From the results, I now understand much more about myself and will be able to create learning strategies specific to me. For example, from the online learning test, I have learned that I’m more of a visual learner. Therefore, I should incorporate more visual elements like pictures and diagrams into my revision and notes to help me learn the materials as effectively as possible.
In addition, I also have a similar score in auditory. The best way to have both visually and auditory is to have videos in my revisions sessions. Videos will have both visuals and audio elements in them so it will be the most effective way for me to revise for any upcoming assignments and exams.

    <h1>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>  
        Since I am classified as an introvert I’ll not be as active when it comes to group conversations. This means that I’ll be more of an observer in my team, instead of the person giving out constant ideas, I’ll more likely be the one to provide suggestions and ways to improve upon ideas that have been brought up by other members of the team. 
Since I will rarely be the one that comes up with the first idea, I could focus on giving out suggestions to the team. For example, researching past successful projects and showing them to my team so I can give inspirations to my teammates. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        When finding teammates I should look for extrovert people since they are more likely to be the first to come up with or suggest a project idea so an introvert like myself will be able to build upon it and try to give some suggestions to the idea.
In addition, teammates that have the same learning or thinking traits as me would also be a factor. If each of the team members has their own ways of developing an application, we would end up clashing and will slow down the development process.
