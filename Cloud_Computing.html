                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Cloud computing is arguably one of the fastest growing sectors of the IT industry. A report by MarketsandMarkets has pointed out that “...the cloud computing market size is expected to grow from USD 445.3 billion in 2021 to USD 947.3 billion by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 16.3% during the forecast period.”[1] This is an astonishing number for an industry that its first technologies developed is barely a decade old. Right now, cloud computing is being implemented in all corners of the world ranging from storing your personal photos and videos to building a network to keeping track of all medical records in a country. According to Microsoft, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale [2]. With cloud computing, organizations no longer have to use on-premise hardware which takes up a lot of space, is costly to run and maintenance as all of the data now can be stored virtually on the Internet and can be easily accessed while you only have to pay a subscription to a provider of your choice. This has made cloud computing become the most cost-efficient method to build IT infrastructure. In addition to that, this technology also is a sustainable solution for lowering the carbon monoxide level as heavy equipment needed for on-premises produced an exorbitant amount of electricity therefore improving energy efficiency. Cloud computing also provides users with its flexibility as you will use a pay-as-you-go system which means an organization can increase their usage of data whenever they can and accommodate more complex features and data activities without having to buy new hardware. The application of cloud computing is crucial to the success of streaming services such as Spotify, Netflix, etc, as it provides scalability and larger data storage for the platform. Cloud computing is clearly revolutionizing the way we store our data and it will only improve with more methods being developed. A big disadvantage of cloud computing is the risks of latency, since the database of a business is stored in a remote area by a provider like AWS and Microsoft Azure, the users have to deal with the delay of their request, it affects the enjoyability of the product which leads to dissatisfaction. An effort in trying to improve this issue has resulted in the application of edge computing. While edge computing isn’t a new concept but with the increasing number of IoT devices, it has projected this technology to a new height. With the trajectory for the last few years, Edge is going to become the new cloud. This is a method of optimization for the cloud architecture by analyzing data at the network ‘edge’ which brings the data closer to the source hence reducing the cost and fastens the response time to the users request. In addition to that, edge computing provides the ability to expand the cloud database without using storage from a cloud service provider and reduce the risks of cybersecurity breach which is also one of the main concerns with cloud computing. With the implementation of this development, for example, surgery procedures can be assisted with robots as they will provide swift and precise information to the doctor. There are multiple cloud computing services but most notably are software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) with SaaS is the most popular one but recently with cloud computing becoming more prevalent, IaaS potential is slowly utilized and is expected to outgrow SaaS in the future. Many companies use IaaS when they are trying to migrate their on-premise infrastructure to a cloud database to save cost and gain real-time insights on the business. However, the cloud migration strategies right now are taking the easiest path is ‘lift and shift’ instead of refactoring. In order to achieve true cloud optimization, a business must modernize the process and develop cloud-native skills. This has opened up a new market for finding applicants with good cloud IaaS skills in recent years and probably more in the future as these skills will enhance efficiency in every sector of cloud computing like increasing the stability of the connection to the cloud or assist a business with disaster recovery.

                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Cloud computing has become indispensable as it is impactful on many aspects of our society. Streaming services exist because of the cloud, by using cloud-based apps like Netflix, Spotify, etc, users can access their favorite songs and movies anytime and anywhere in the world. One of my preferred applications of cloud has been the ability to access thousands of academic courses from renowned universities from around the world like MIT, Duke, or famously, the CS50 course of Harvard for free. Recorded lessons and all the materials used in these courses are now stored in the cloud which students can easily request for the data anytime they want. The devastating impact of COVID-19 pandemic has furthermore accelerated the adoption of cloud computing as it has made people strictly communicate and collaborate online. The technology also accounted for the success of tracking and monitoring the infected patients with an effort to minimize the catastrophic effects by using the inputted data of citizens to build a wide network of locations and behaviors of people in contact with the infected and storing all the information to the cloud database. Cloud computing also has the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry with big names like Steam, Google announcing new cloud-based gaming devices in recent years. For example, with a monthly subscription, players now don’t have to buy expensive PC hardware to be able to play smoothly and spend 60$ for each triple AAA graded game coming out each month. Thanks to the power of the cloud, games now can be streamed directly to the user’s devices, this also reduces the latency and response time while the game is playing on high definition. With all these benefits, the IT market is witnessing a spike in demand for cloud jobs with the salary for a cloud engineer has skyrocketed to become one of the most well-paid jobs for an engineer. For example, the cloud is accountable for the increase of outsourcing work, which Vietnam is one of the most popular places for employing lower wages programmers. There has been a surge in outsourced cloud jobs for maintenance and developing health care networks for hospitals in Japan on IT job platforms like TopDev and itviec. While positions like Sysadmin and IT help desk are becoming obsolete because of the cloud, they are only migrating their platform to a cloud-based environment, learning about how to develop the cloud and this has increased their salary as well.

                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; padding-bottom:100px;";"> As an average consumer, one may not fully grasp the importance of cloud computing but for me, with all of my personal data stored in the cloud, I have utilized the benefits of the cloud to my own liking. Ever since I was able to access the Internet, I have been using cloud-based applications like Mega, Google Drive to store videos, images or songs. In addition to that, I also consumed social media content on Youtube, Instagram, etc, for hours daily and all of my school documents, assignment are stored on Canvas. Cloud computing has always played a huge role in my daily life even if I didn’t understand the concept of the cloud till recently. With the advancement of this technology, I am able to stream movies without disruption of weak connection, play video games on high- definition quality and store terabytes of resources. My family owns a small chemical-related business, they buy and sell different chemicals to many industries like textile or fertilizer. Thanks to the convenience of cloud computing, all the transaction details are stored on the internet, getting rid of hours of manually printing or writing down each of the receipts.
