                        or on the weekend with my siblings. I got introduced to playing badminton by my grandfather 
                        in 6th grade. I have played badminton on and off ever since. All my experience from badminton 
                        comes from just playing it with my friends at school and watching my grandfather since he is very 
                        good at the sport. I would say that I am average or above at best. Currently I am in the IT hub group 
                        consisting of Nguyen Bao Minh, Tran Viet Hoang, and Le Nhat Quang

I would say I am a competitive person so I enjoy playing competitive shooter games with friends in my free time. I used to attend Nguyen Sieu highschool. There, I partook in the IGCSE program for 2 years which taught me a great amount about enterprise, travel and tourism and global perspectives. I am currently a member of team IT Hub, consisting of me, Tran Viet Hoang, Tran Duc Thang and Le Nhat Quang.</p>

                <p class="backgroun-info"><strong>Intersing Fact:</strong> One of my fascinating characteristics is that I enjoy playing basketball a lot. For example, when I was in high school, I would spend hours after school with my buddies playing basketball, but when I started university, I couldn't really practice this activity because of the pandemic, and I couldn't find a decent court to play on. Moreover, most of my previous partners were now playing with their new colleagues in university and didn't have as much time to play as we had in high school.
