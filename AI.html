Instances like Siri or Alexa are only a few examples of how AI has been integrated into society. The term AI refers to “the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.” (Copeland 2021). While machine learning is “is an application or subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data without being programmed explicitly.”[2] From things as simple as entertainment websites or softwares have AI in the form of self-learning and self-compiling algorithms that recommend or hide videos or pictures based on our interest. To complex AIs used in industries and companies for the sake of automation to conserve time and reduce cost. AI can also point out flaws we humans cannot detect and optimize procedures and processes to its fullest. Cloud computing - a subset of AI helps organizations operate with more fluidity. Or chatbots, another product of AI, like Watson Assistant, “an AI-powered assistant, developed by IBM which can run across various channels like websites, messengers, and apps and requires zero human intervention once programmed.”[7]. AI as of now, is not yet self-aware and can only operate within closed parameters. One of the closest features AI may bring us in the near future is AI-operated vehicles. In fact, AI-controlled car-parking has already been implemented in various recent car models. The company Tesla is striving towards making a fully AI-controlled car that can drive, park without the assistance of human passengers.

                    <p style="word-spacing:3px; line-height:25px; margin-bottom:40px;";"> Machine learning has made its way into almost every industry over the years. Its ability to process past information then using it to determine and execute functions is highly beneficial to automating specific aspects of certain industries. For example, the medical industry has been utilizing AI for several purposes. To list a few: disease identification/diagnosis, smart electronic health records, smart electronic health records, personalized treatment [3]. Security has also seen great improvements in its various sectors. In terms of cybersecurity, many browsers have built in warnings when users click on a potentially harmful link or an invasive website. Many anti-virus softwares use AI to determine malicious softwares, provide warnings then quarantine said softwares. The most notable instance of this is Windows Defender with its automatic detection and automatic scan, ensuring your computer is secured and safe from malwares. Facial recognition, a product of AI and machine learning, is also revolutionary when it comes to improving security in buildings or personal properties. AI also gave birth to self-parking features in cars. The company Tesla is also pushing boundaries by aiming towards fully self-driving cars with their autopilot AI. Although it is still in its beta stages, with a tester even claiming the feature to be “Critically flawed” [4],  self-driving vehicles have the potential to make traffic safer “...94% of serious crashes are due to human error. Automated vehicles have the potential to remove human error from the crash equation, which will help protect drivers and passengers, as well as bicyclists and pedestrians.” [5]. We cannot be certain about how else AI and machine learning will influence the world in the future. But there are a plethora of predictions of how it may do so. An instance is a world where all vehicles are AI-operated and all means of transport are automated. This will greatly reduce traffic risks, congestion which can save time, cost and even lives. Self-driving trucks will help companies greatly reduce costs and possibly even lower the travel time as AI drivers do not need to stop to fulfill biological needs. Or the future when construction workers are replaced by machines and managed by AI. This will eradicate casualties at construction sites and possibly reduce the time taken for a project to finish. Despite all the benefits it may bring, AI also poses risks for the future. Many scientists and researchers have worded their concern about AI gaining sentience and having goals that misalign with us humans. Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest minds in our modern times, has voiced his concern regarding AI: “Success in creating effective AI, could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just don’t know. So we cannot know if we will be infinitely helped by AI, or ignored by it and side-lined, or be conceivably destroyed by it,”[6]. With how the world is becoming more and more digitized, we can only imagine what kind of actions the AIs would take when they become self-aware. AI will continue to be developed to be more complex and to fulfill more difficult roles. Whether they will continue to help us humans or turn against us is unknowable. But as of this moment, AI is one of the greatest tools we invented and hopefully will continue to be so.

With AI becoming more and more prevalent, even being integrated into our daily lives through phone AIs like Siri or smart home AIs like Alexa, our lives will become vastly more automated and convenient. Personally, I love the prospect of a smart home, where you can turn on the lights without reaching for the lightswitch, open garage doors without having to exit your vehicles or even automatically adjusting the heat of your oven or stove when cooking based on a timer. Such features can be of so much help after a long day at work or on days when you are sick and struggle to get out of bed. Our means of entertainment is often generated or suggested by AI. Apps such as YouTube or TikTok have algorithms that determine our preferences based on what kind of videos we click on, how long we watch them, which channels we subscribe to to recommend similar videos and creators to help boost our enjoyment. My parents are not tech-savvy nor are they enthusiastic enough to find new types of videos to watch but thanks to those algorithms, my parents can still enjoy videos and even find new ones through the suggestion tab. This also applies to my younger cousins who are still young children but are still provided with a wide variety of video content for children the moment they open the apps on their iPads. AIs on your phones are extremely beneficial when you are driving. My dad likes to use Siri when he is driving. Phone AIs like Siri can be activated with just voice commands. You can then tell them to complete tasks such as make an appointment or text someone without taking your eyes off the road.
